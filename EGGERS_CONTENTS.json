{"home":{"content":"# Jukebox\n---\n\nWelcome to Lecture 18! Here's a brief class breakdown.\n\n#### Learning Objectives\n---\n\n1. Build a legit application incorporating all the stuff we learned thus far.\n\n#### To Do Today\n---\n#### [Warmup](#warmup)\n#### [Project Desc](#project-desc)","idx":0},"title":{"content":"Jukebox","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"Build a Spotify API based jukebox app","idx":2},"warmup":{"content":"# Warmup\n---\n\nLet's begin with a few review problems.\n\n#### Problem 1\n---\n\nBuild an asynchronous add function with callbacks. \n\n```js\nasyncAdd(1,2, (sum) => {\n    console.log(sum); // 3\n});\n```\n\n#### Problem 2\n---\n\nBuild an asynchronous add function with promises. \n\n```js\npromiseAdd(1,2)\n    .then((sum) => {\n        console.log(sum); // 3\n    });\n```\n\nUsing this definition, call your function three times and console.log out the results with **all three** have returned.\n\n#### Problem 3\n---\n\nBuild an asynchronous add function with async/await. \n\n```js\nawaitAdd(1,2).then((sum) => {\n    console.log(sum);\n});\n```\n\n#### Stretch Goals\n---\n\nLet's build a simple script loader. Using google, find out how to **load a javascript file** into your HTML code **dynamically**.\n\nBasically, something like this:\n\n```js\nloadJSFile('javascript/NumberAPI.js')\n    .then(() => {\n        // in here, your NumbersAPI.js \n        // object should be loaded\n    });\n```\n\nBuild this any way you see fit.\n\n\n","idx":3},"project-desc":{"content":"# Spotify Jukebox\n---\n\nThis is **your** project to build. Feel free to use any frameworks, libraries, and coding patterns you want.\n\nBelow, I will outline definitive project guidelines and a list of ideas on how you could get started. Your project to meet the guidelines provided but again, you are free to decide however you want to organize and use your code.\n\n#### Guidelines\n---\n\nYou are to build a jukebox with the following features:\n\n1. User is able to search via an input field *OR* button click for **album**, **song**, **artist**, OR **playlist**.\n2. ","idx":4},"__list__":["home","title","desc","warmup","project-desc"]}
